# spatial_analysis_with_python
This repository is meant to serve as a gentle introduction to open source Python development for the geospatial-minded. In order to start, install Python (though I always recommend Conda) and set up the Requirements.txt file. 

Step by Step instructions to get your Python environment set up:
1) I recommend installing Python via Anaconda (Miniconda is the barebones solution: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2) After installing Conda, open up your Anaconda Command Prompt and CD your the empty directory of choice. Use conda to install git by typing in "conda install -c conda-forge git"
3) After git has successfully been installed, clone this repository into your empty folder. Next, create a new Conda environment with the appropriate dependencies by typing in "conda env create -f environments.yml"
4) Once complete, type in "conda activate spatial_analysis" to activate this environemnt.

You should be all set!
